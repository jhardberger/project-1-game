						OTHER NOTES

overall goals/gameplan: 

basic gameplay: 
	-user types a randomly generated phrase into an input
	-by typing this phrase, they advance an animation 
	frame by frame, moving a hitbox into the path of 
	a projectile
	-by intercepting said projectile, (or dodging it), 
	the player gains points/perpetuates the game
	-failing to do so results in docked points, 
	or the game's untimely end

mini-game outlines: 
	-GAME 1: home run derby: 
	the player controls a batter, and by completing the 
	assigned phrase moves his bat into the path of 
	an oncomming fastball - get there in time
	and you hit a home run!
	-STRETCH:
