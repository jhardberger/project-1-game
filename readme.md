GAME PROJECT USER STORIES

CONCEPT 1: TYPECASTER

A typing game in which users harness their QWERTY skills to complete an objective, like destorying an enemy spaceship or hitting a home run. 

A user will be able to...
	-type along with randomly generated words and phrases and, in entering the correct keystrokes, advance a Canvas animation frame-by-frame to intercept a target (see examples).
	-see their current score displayed on screen and continue playing until they fail to intercept their target.  
	-keep score between multiple players, competing for the high score. 

There are two main mini-games I have in mind for this that I believe could be built off the same framework: 
	
	1. A spaceship battle, in which the user plays a stationary starfighter with enemies advancing along a line with animation. By completing the phrase before the enemy ships make contact, the user ship will charge and fire a laser to destry the enemy - but longer, harder words and faster ships will keep coming. LOSE CONDITION: enemy ships make contact. STRETCH GOAL: a hard mode where the user ship bobs up and down on the Y axis, so that the final keystroke must be entered - and the laser fired - at just the right time to intercept the enemy ship. 
	
	2. A baseball game, in which the user plays a batter taking pitches, which advance along a line with animation. By completing the phrase before the ball passes over the plate, the batter puts his bat in the path of the ball and hits a home run. LOSE CONDITION: 3 strikes, you're out. STRETCH GOALS: a time component that would hit the ball for different amounts of points, as well as variable pitch speed, to keep the user guessing. 


CONCEPT 2: FRUIT CATCHER/KNIFE DODGER

A more canvas-heavy concept, this game will have users controlling a character that moves back and forth across the screen on the x-axis, dodging some objects(knives) while trying to catch others (fruit).

A user will be able to... 
	-control an on-screen character with keystrokes, moving back and forth to dodge and catch the falling objects, which will move down from the top of the screen in straight lines, using canvas animation. 
	-gain health by catching fruit and lose health by failing dodge knives. 
	-attempt to survive as long as they can by keeping their health above 0. 
	-keep score between multiple players, competing for high score. 

STRETCH GOAL: maybe have two players competing at once?


CONCEPT 3: MURDER PARTY - A CLUE CLONE

A low-budget take on the classic mystery-solving boardgame, this game will be mostly text based - perhaps with a jquary/canvas-based map that registers the players' current locations. It'll be somewhat simplified from the original version, with a smaller board and fewer players and items, but could get closer to the real deal in STRETCH GOALS. 

A user will be able to...
	-select one of 6 crappy bootleg version of Clue characters, and navigate them through a text-based or very simply rendered mansion, checking clues. 
	-guess at the end of the game who committed the murder and how in order to win.
	-play against another human character - or, STRETCH GOAL, possibly a very stupid, random-integer-based "ai".
