GAME PROJECT USER STORIES

TYPECASTER or WPM DERBY

This is a typing game in which users harness their QWERTY skills to smack sweet home runs like [inset name of favorite baseball player here, I don't want to fight about it]!

A user will be able to...
	-type along with randomly generated words and phrases and, in entering the correct keystrokes, advance an animated slugger frame-by-frame to smack one out of the park.
	-duel a pitcher capabale of throwing balls as a variety of speeds, but be careful: the words the player is required to type will keep getitng longer, harder to spell and more nonsensical.  
	-register their score at the end of the round and compete with other players on a leaderboard.
