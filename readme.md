#QWERTY DERBY

##A typing game that's... actually kind of hard?

This is a typing game in which users harness their QWERTY skills to smack sweet home runs like [inset name of favorite baseball player here, I don't want to fight about it]!

A user can type along with randomly generated words and phrases and, in entering the correct keystrokes, advance an animated slugger frame-by-frame to knock one out of the park, dueling a pitcher capabale of throwing balls as a range of random speeds. But be careful: the words the player is required to type will keep getitng longer, harder to spell, and more nonsensical. And just like in real baseball, it's three strikes - you're out.
